[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]This mod is the result of the proposition Cad'ika Orade made on my collection page. The idea was to be able to control an army of goats.
So as some mods already exist to create more goats, I decided to make a mod that give other goats a special "knight AI" able to follow the player and attack random enemies.
To make them follow I used a really simple method, every knight goat simply walk in the direction fo the player, and if there is an other knight in its trajectory it stop just after it.
About the attack, I used the same method I used for the Zombie AI and customized it to avoid that knights attack their king or other knights of the same king.
I also had to add an ugly fix to avoid knights to ragdoll all the time: the basic goat AI ragdoll them every time they collide with something, so I tried to prevent that.
